One of the conveniences of the use of a console as a base for a gaming platform is the absence of the want to always replace the current innards in order to experience the state-of-the-art games. Consoles are continually designed to have a lifespan of at least 5 years. While visible enhancements to software program will demand higher hardware, consoles typically adapt to the optimization technique as quality they can. With the younger Playstation 5, Sony is already speaking about the subsequent technology of consoles. Not due to the fact in the identify of marketing, but for arguments in opposition to Microsoft's acquisition of Activision.

In the written argument they submitted to associated parties, discussing the final time of cooperation they have with Call of Duty, it is believed that the contract will cease in 2027. Sony stated that this timing would coincide with the launch of the brand new technology of Playstation consoles (Playstation 6) the place they would no longer have get admission to to Call of Duty or different Activision games. Sony believes this state of affairs will expose Sony to a workable shift in client structures and ultimately, a big discount in the stage of opposition in the market.
