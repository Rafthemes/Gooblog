Collaboration between anime and games is commonplace, this is intended to increase sales of the game, considering that animelovers fans are very busy, this can also be pretty good marketing in the game.

**Fortnite** is a Battleground Crafting themed game. This game is very popular among PC, Mobile and Console. There are lots of Fortnite players around the world.

It is appropriate for Fortnite to collaborate with Anime **My Hero Academia** or **"Boku no Hero Academia"** considering that My Hero Academia is one of the most successful and popular anime in Japan, from its initial release until now

Reported from Fortnite's official Twitter page. It was announced that they would be collaborating with My Hero Academia on **December, 16 2022** at the time of this posting.

For now, there are no leaks regarding the My Hero Academia characters that will be included in the collaboration later. Hopefully it's not far from the expectations of the fans.
